# basic_screen_saver
Code to make a basic screen saver, with several different coloured bouncing bubbles.

Note:
- uses python, tkinter and random.

A few things to keep in mind:
- the code to generate the random colours doesnt always proper code. 
- need to replace that code with a better random colour generator.
