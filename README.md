# basic_screen_saver
Code to make a basic screen saver, with several different coloured bouncing bubbles.

Note:
- Uses Python and TKinter.

A few things to keep in mind:
- The code to generate the random colours doesnt always proper code. 
- Need to replace that code with a better random colour generator.
